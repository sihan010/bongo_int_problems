1. Given structure: 

interface Vehicle{

	int set_num_of_wheels();

	int set_num_of_passengers();

	boolean has_gas();

}



Comments on given interface - setter method should have ability to receive argument, which will be set to a specific variable later on.



a) Since we are given an interface Vehicle, our Car and Plane classes will have to implement the interface. Which means, inside Car and Plane class we have

to define the body of set_num_of_wheels, set_num_of_passengers and has_gas methods. Each class will have 3 variables to store wheel, passenger and gas values.

code is in Abstraction.java



b) Besides interfaces we can use abstract classes. Abstract class will contain 3 variables to store wheel, passenger and gas values. 3 abstract methods 

set_num_of_wheels, set_num_of_passengers and has_gas methods which will be implemented by the inheriting classes. Car and Plane classes will inherit from 

Vehicle class and will have access to their own sets of variables and concrete methods. In Car and Plane class we will implement Vehicle class's abstract

methods to set or get the variables. I also added a concrete method result_string() to get a formatted result in Vehicle class, which will also be available 

to Car and Plane classes by inheriting the Vehicle class.

code is in Abstraction_proposed.java
