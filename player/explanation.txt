I will propose to have a Media interface which will contain the definitions for three methods 
play, forward and rewind. MediaPlayer class will implement the interface and complete those methods. 

MediaPlayer class will contain lots of variables to keep track of its states, for example - 
mediaLength, currentTime, isPlaying etc. When MediaPlayer class is initiated it'll take a 
video/audio path and initialize its variables.

play method will render frames to the screen according to currentTime while checking mediaLength. 
It will also increment currentTime while playing. Depending on isPlaying variable play method 
can play or pause media files. 

forward method will increment currentTime by 10 if currentTime+10 is less than mediaLength and 
play/pause according to isPlaying.

rewind method will decrement currentTime by 10 if currentTime-10 is larger than 0 and play/pause 
according to isPlaying.

Code Demo can be found at MediaPlayer.java
Comments are added to explain functionalities.
